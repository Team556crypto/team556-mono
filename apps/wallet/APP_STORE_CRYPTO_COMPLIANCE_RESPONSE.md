# App Store Review Response - Cryptocurrency Exchange Compliance
## Team556 Digital Armory - Version 1.0.1
## Submission ID: 099e76ff-2773-4742-9ff4-b3dd41f97a23

---

## Executive Summary

Team556 Digital Armory is a **semi-custodial cryptocurrency wallet** that provides users with an interface to interact with **decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols** on the Solana blockchain. While we maintain certain security features for user protection, the app does NOT operate as a cryptocurrency exchange service requiring MSB licensing.

---

## Nature of the System

### Semi-Custodial Architecture:
1. **Encrypted Key Management**: Private keys are encrypted and stored on our secure servers with user password encryption
2. **User Control**: Users maintain control through their passwords and can export their seed phrases
3. **Security Benefits**: Provides recovery options and enhanced security against device loss
4. **Transaction Authorization**: All transactions require user authentication and explicit approval

### Swap Feature Implementation:
1. **DEX Interface Only**: The swap feature interfaces with Jupiter Aggregator (a DEX aggregator protocol)
2. **No Exchange Operations**: We do not operate an exchange, match orders, or provide liquidity
3. **Protocol Integration**: Swaps execute through Solana blockchain smart contracts
4. **User-Initiated**: All swaps are explicitly initiated and authorized by users

### What the App DOES NOT Do:
1. **No Exchange Services**: We do not operate as a cryptocurrency exchange
2. **No Order Book**: We do not maintain an order book or match buyers with sellers
3. **No Liquidity Pools**: We do not provide or manage liquidity for trades
4. **No Proprietary Trading**: We are not the counterparty to any trades
5. **No Fiat Operations**: The app does not support fiat currency deposits or withdrawals

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### DEX Integration
The swap feature integrates with **Jupiter Aggregator V6 API**, which:
- Is a decentralized protocol running on Solana blockchain
- Aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs (Orca, Raydium, etc.)
- Executes swaps through smart contracts, not through our servers

### Code References
- Swap functionality: `/components/drawers/payments/SwapDrawerContent.tsx`
- API integration: `/services/api/swap.ts`
- The app only:
  1. Fetches quotes from Jupiter's public API
  2. Helps users construct transactions
  3. Allows users to sign transactions with their private keys
  4. Broadcasts signed transactions to the Solana network

### Transaction Flow
1. User requests a swap quote (SOL â†” TEAM tokens)
2. App queries Jupiter Aggregator for best route
3. App displays quote to user
4. User approves and signs transaction locally
5. Signed transaction is broadcast to Solana blockchain
6. Smart contracts execute the swap directly on-chain

## Compliance Clarifications

### Why Exchange Licenses Are Not Required:

1. **No Exchange Operations**: We do not operate an exchange - we only provide an interface to existing DEX protocols
2. **Third-Party Protocols**: All swaps occur through independent, decentralized protocols (Jupiter) on the Solana blockchain
3. **No Order Matching**: We do not match orders, maintain order books, or facilitate peer-to-peer trades
4. **No Counterparty Role**: We are never the counterparty to any trades
5. **Interface Only**: We provide software that interfaces with existing blockchain protocols

### Semi-Custodial Model Compliance:
1. **User Authorization Required**: All transactions require explicit user authorization via password
2. **Encryption Standards**: Private keys are encrypted using industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
3. **User Data Protection**: We implement robust security measures to protect user data
4. **Recovery Options**: Users can recover their wallets through secure recovery processes
5. **Export Capability**: Users can export their seed phrases to move to fully non-custodial solutions

### Comparison to Other Approved Apps:
Our semi-custodial model with DEX interface is similar to:
- Coinbase Wallet (semi-custodial options with DEX features)
- Blockchain.com Wallet (custodial elements with trading features)
- Other wallet apps that provide enhanced security through server-side encrypted storage

## Proposed App Store Description Update

To ensure clarity for App Store review and users, we propose updating our app description to explicitly state:

```
Team556 Digital Armory is a semi-custodial cryptocurrency wallet for the Solana blockchain 
that provides enhanced security through encrypted key storage. The swap feature provides 
an interface to decentralized exchange protocols (DEXs) where all trades occur directly 
on the blockchain through smart contracts. We do not operate as a cryptocurrency exchange, 
maintain order books, or act as a counterparty to trades. Users maintain control of their 
funds through password-protected access and can export their seed phrases at any time.
```

## Distribution Limitations

### Current Distribution:
- **United States**: Available in all states where non-custodial wallets are permitted
- The app will be configured to respect any geographic restrictions required by Apple

### Features by Region:
- Core wallet functionality (sending/receiving): Available globally
- DEX interface (swap feature): Can be disabled for specific regions if required

---

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC)

### Current Implementation:

1. **User Registration**: We collect basic user information during account creation for security purposes
2. **Transaction Monitoring**: All transactions are recorded on the public Solana blockchain
3. **No Fiat Operations**: The app does not support fiat currency operations
4. **Compliance Ready**: We are prepared to implement additional KYC/AML measures if required by jurisdiction

### Security Measures:
1. **Account Security**: Password-protected accounts with encryption
2. **Transaction Limits**: Can implement transaction limits if required
3. **Audit Trail**: All blockchain transactions are permanently recorded and traceable
4. **User Responsibility**: Users are informed of their responsibility for tax and regulatory compliance

## Summary and Request

Team556 Digital Armory operates as a **semi-custodial wallet with DEX interface capabilities**, not as a cryptocurrency exchange. Key distinctions:

1. **Wallet Service**: We provide secure wallet services with encrypted key storage
2. **DEX Interface**: The swap feature only interfaces with third-party DEX protocols
3. **No Exchange Operations**: We do not operate, control, or provide exchange services
4. **User Control**: Users maintain control through passwords and can export seed phrases

We respectfully request that the app be approved as a semi-custodial wallet application that provides users with access to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, similar to other approved wallet apps with comparable features.

### Our Commitments:
1. **Geographic Compliance**: We will restrict features based on regional requirements
2. **User Protection**: We maintain robust security measures for user protection
3. **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of our semi-custodial model to users
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ready to implement additional compliance measures as needed

If any specific regions require the swap feature to be disabled or additional compliance measures, we are prepared to implement these requirements immediately.
