# Solana Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, you would need to add a proper Solana logo PNG image file here.

The file should be:
- PNG format
- Approximately 60x32px for WooCommerce checkout
- Transparent background
- Official Solana purple color (#9945FF)

You can download the official Solana logo from the Solana branding guidelines or create a simple wordmark that says "Team556 Token" with the Solana logo.
