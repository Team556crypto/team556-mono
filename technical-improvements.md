# Technical Improvements for Team556 Monorepo

## 1. Observability & Monitoring

**Current state:** Minimal implementation with basic health check endpoints.

**Recommendations:**

- **Structured Logging:**

  - Implement [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) for Express and [Zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for Go
  - Add request/response logging middleware with correlation IDs across services
  - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR based on environment

- **Metrics Collection:**

  - Implement Prometheus metrics for both servers
  - Track: Request counts, latencies, error rates, resource utilization
  - Express: Use [prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client)
  - Go: Use [prometheus-go-client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang)

- **Distributed Tracing:**

  - Implement OpenTelemetry across services
  - Track request flow between client apps and backend services
  - Visualize with Jaeger or Zipkin

- **Health Checks & Alerting:**

  - Enhanced health endpoints with component status (DB, cache, dependent services)
  - Implement readiness/liveness probes for Kubernetes
  - Set up alerts for downtime, error spikes, latency increases

- **Monitoring Dashboard:**
  - Grafana for metrics visualization
  - ELK stack or Loki for log aggregation
  - Integration with PagerDuty or similar for alerts

## 2. CI/CD Implementation

**Current state:** No formal CI/CD implementation.

**Recommendations:**

- **GitHub Actions Workflow:**

  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/ci.yml
  name: CI/CD Pipeline
  on: [push, pull_request]
  jobs:
    test:
      # Test job configuration
    lint:
      # Lint job configuration
    build:
      # Build job configuration
    deploy:
      # Deployment configuration
  ```

- **Testing Strategy:**

  - Unit tests for all services with Jest (JS) and Go's testing package
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - End-to-end tests with Cypress for web applications
  - Snapshot testing for React Native components

- **Build & Deployment:**

  - Leverage Turborepo for efficient builds
  - Configure Docker builds for server components
  - Set up staging and production environments
  - Implement blue-green or canary deployments

- **Quality Gates:**
  - Code coverage requirements (>80%)
  - SonarQube integration for code quality analysis
  - Security scanning for dependencies (Snyk/Dependabot)
  - Performance testing for critical endpoints

## 3. Monorepo Management

**Current state:** Using Turborepo with basic configuration.

**Recommendations:**

- **Enhanced Turborepo Config:**

  - Add caching for faster builds
  - Remote caching for CI environment
  - Optimize task dependencies for parallelization

- **Package Versioning:**

  - Implement Changesets for version management
  - Automate release notes generation
  - Configure Semantic Versioning guidelines

- **Development Experience:**

  - Add git hooks with Husky for pre-commit checks
  - Standardize code formatting with Prettier
  - Implement consistent documentation approach

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Use strict workspace protocols
  - Add dependency visualization tools
  - Regular dependency updates with automated PRs

## 4. Database Strategy

**Current state:** No database implementation.

**Recommendations:**

- **Database Selection:**

  - Primary transactional DB: PostgreSQL
  - Caching layer: Redis
  - Consider MongoDB for flexible document storage if needed

- **Data Architecture:**

  - Implement repository pattern to abstract data access
  - Use database migrations with Prisma or similar
  - Implement connection pooling for performance

- **Schema Design:**

  - Normalize data for transactional integrity
  - Design with future scaling in mind
  - Implement proper indexing strategy

- **Backups & Disaster Recovery:**

  - Automated daily backups
  - Point-in-time recovery capability
  - Regular restoration testing

- **Scaling Strategy:**

  - Read replicas for heavy read operations
  - Sharding strategy for write scaling if needed
  - Connection pooling configuration

- **Implementation:**
  - Go: Use GORM or sqlx with PostgreSQL driver
  - Node.js: Implement Prisma ORM for type-safe database access

## 5. State Management

**Current state:** React Context API and useState hooks.

**Recommendations:**

- **Implement Zustand:**

  - Convert existing Context implementations to Zustand stores
  - Create separate stores for different domains (auth, UI, data)
  - Example implementation:

  ```tsx
  // stores/authStore.ts
  import create from 'zustand'

  interface AuthState {
    user: User | null
    isAuthenticated: boolean
    login: (credentials: Credentials) => Promise<void>
    logout: () => void
  }

  export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>(set => ({
    user: null,
    isAuthenticated: false,
    login: async credentials => {
      // Authentication logic
      set({ user: userData, isAuthenticated: true })
    },
    logout: () => set({ user: null, isAuthenticated: false })
  }))
  ```

- **Authentication & Session:**

  - Secure token storage with Expo SecureStore
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Session timeout handling

- **Offline Support:**

  - Implement offline-first architecture with local-first data
  - Sync engine for multi-device data consistency
  - Conflict resolution strategy

- **Persistence:**
  - Add middleware for state persistence
  - Use encrypted storage for sensitive data
  - Clear separation between persisted and ephemeral state

## 6. Security Measures

**Current state:** Basic Helmet and CORS implementation.

**Recommendations:**

- **API Security:**

  - Implement JWT-based authentication
  - Add refresh token rotation
  - CSRF protection for web clients

- **Rate Limiting:**

  ```typescript
  // middleware/rateLimit.ts
  import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

  export const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    standardHeaders: true,
    legacyHeaders: false,
    message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
  })

  // Apply to specific routes or globally
  app.use('/api/sensitive-endpoints', apiLimiter)
  ```

- **Request Validation:**

  - Implement Joi or Zod for schema validation
  - Validate all request parameters, query strings, and body
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

- **Token Security:**

  - Short-lived access tokens
  - Implement token revocation mechanism
  - Store token metadata for auditing

- **Secure Headers:**

  - Enhance Helmet configuration with strict CSP
  - Implement proper CORS with specific origins
  - Add security headers for all responses

- **Dependency Scanning:**

  - Regular audit of npm dependencies
  - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI
  - Dependency update strategy

- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Audit logging for security events
  - Alert on suspicious patterns
  - Regular security reviews
